channels:
  - conda-forge
  - pytorch
  - nvidia
  - defaults
dependencies:
  - python=3.10.12
  - pip
  - numpy
  - mamba  # optional: faster solver (will be used by the create script if present)

# Note:
# - We intentionally do not install `torch` via pip here. The helper script
#   installs PyTorch via conda (pytorch + pytorch-cuda) to avoid wheel/driver
#   mismatches. After PyTorch is installed via conda the script will pip-install
#   the remainder of the project's `requirements.txt` while excluding torch.
